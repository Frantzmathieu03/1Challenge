## Module 1 02 Challenge

1- I was asked to replace all the "div" tags by other tags elements.


2- In this project, I've replaced <div> tags with semantic HTML elements such as <section>, <nav>, <aside>, and others 

Changes Made
Replaced generic <div> tags with appropriate semantic HTML elements:
<header>: Used for introductory content including the site's title and navigation menu.
<nav>: Used to represent the section containing navigation links.
<section>: Used to encapsulate distinct thematic content sections of the webpage.
<article>: Used to represent standalone content that can be distributed independently.
<aside>: Used for content that is tangentially related to the main content.
<footer>: Used to represent the footer section of the webpage.
